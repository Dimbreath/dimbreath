Hi I'm Dimbreath!

I'm just someone who's interested in reverse engineering and security, mainly games for now. I also develop bots for Discord (Yufine for Epic Seven, Skadi for Arknights and Ganyu for Genshin Impact.)

My motivation for doing all what I do is my own learning and then contributing to communities. With that said, crediting is really appreciated because people *always* forgets and ignores how hard some games can be and I think the people that do this don't get appreciated enough.
