Hi I'm Dimbreath!

I... uh... don't do much. I'm just someone who's interested in reverse engineering and security, mainly games for now. I also develop bots for Discord  (Yufine for Epic Seven, Skadi for Arknights and Ganyu for Genshin Impact.)

My original motivation for doing all what I do is my own learning and then contributing to communities in a different way or "from the side." With that said, crediting is really appreciated because people *always* forgets and ignores how hard some games can be and I think the people that do this don't get appreciated enough.

Please don't ask me for tools or how to reverse engineer a specific game or stuff like that.
