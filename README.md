Hi I'm Dimbreath!

I'm just someone who's interested in reverse engineering and security, mainly focusing on games for now. I also develop bots for Discord (["Yufine" for Epic Seven](https://top.gg/bot/533520748396937217), ["Skadi" for Arknights](https://top.gg/bot/667216186966147072) and ["Ganyu" for Genshin Impact.](https://top.gg/bot/768153308590243911))  

My motivation for doing what I do is for my own learning and contributing to communities. With that said, crediting is really appreciated. People tend to not realize the amount of effort required to reverse engineer specific games, and in the case of some games it's quite a lot ðŸ˜….
