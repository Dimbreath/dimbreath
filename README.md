I'm Dimbreath.

I'm just someone who's interested in reverse engineering and security, mainly focusing on games for now. I also develop bots for Discord (["Yufine" for Epic Seven](https://top.gg/bot/533520748396937217), ["Skadi" for Arknights](https://top.gg/bot/667216186966147072) and ["Ganyu" for Genshin Impact.](https://top.gg/bot/768153308590243911))
